B.S. in Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics (4.0 GPA) from the the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

I have a passion for constructing statistical models and optimization algorithms to draw results from large databases. My background in statistics and computer programming enables me to derive predictive inferences from data and effectively address associated problems.

I have experience using SQL, Tableau, Python, R programming, and Java.

2021-2022 President and Co-Founder of the Undergraduate Mathematics Club at UNCC.
